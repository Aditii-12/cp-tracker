# CP Tracker

CP Tracker is a data-driven analytics tool designed to help competitive programmers monitor and analyze their problem-solving performance over time. The project uses public competitive programming platform APIs to fetch real user data and present meaningful insights through statistics and visualizations.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Competitive programming involves continuous practice across different topics and contests, but it is often difficult to objectively track progress and identify weak areas. CP Tracker aims to solve this problem by collecting contest and submission data and converting it into easy-to-understand metrics and trends.

The tool focuses on performance analysis rather than problem solving itself.

## 📊 Features

- Fetches competitive programming data using public APIs  
- Tracks contest rating changes over time  
- Analyzes solved problems by difficulty and topic  
- Identifies strong and weak problem areas based on success patterns  
- Visualizes progress using graphs and summaries  

## 🧩 Data Source

- **Codeforces Public API**
  - User contest history
  - Submission data
  - Problem tags and difficulty levels  

All data used in this project is publicly available and does not require authentication.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Requests, Pandas  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib / Plotly  
- **Interface:** Streamlit
